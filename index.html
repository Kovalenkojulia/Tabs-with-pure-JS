                Yoga, massages and swimming in the sea will help your tired back!
                Indian yogis believed that human health can be determined
                by how healthy and flexible his spine is.<br />
                I wonder what the ancient yogis would say, looking at the modern
                a person who has been suffering from pain in the
                back, works for a long time in uncomfortable sitting positions and cannot
                relax, has a curvature that will eventually lead to
                diseases of other organs? Yogis would say take care of yourself and
                urgently!

                Ayurveda and yoga claim that the main source of health
                our body is a healthy mind. Program "Antistress"
                first removes the effects of stress on the physical level, then
                helps to get rid of negative and obsessive thoughts, then
                increases overall energy levels.<br />
                You will finally remember the feeling of "free head", feel the rush
                physical strength and remember what happiness is.

                One face cream does not solve the problem of body rejuvenation,
                when you are over 40. Do you agree?

                A few years ago we developed special yoga programs
                and Ayurveda - and we realized that they work great - on the experience of 530
                our tourists! Each of these programs has one goal,
                the achievement of which both asanas and respiratory
                practices, and meditations, and Ayurvedic treatments, will be read
                lectures on this topic. <br />Yoga and Ayurveda - two strong war,
                who together will fight problems and diseases.
